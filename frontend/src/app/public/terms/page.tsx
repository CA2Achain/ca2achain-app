      <p className="mb-4">
        By using CA2AChain, you agree to these Terms of Service. Our platform is provided for lawful use only in compliance with California AB 1263 regulations. You agree not to misuse the platform, attempt to circumvent verification processes, or use the service for any illegal purposes.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Buyer verification fees are non-refundable once identity verification is complete. Dealer subscription plans are billed monthly, and unused verification credits do not roll over to the next billing cycle. You may cancel your subscription at any time, with cancellation taking effect at the end of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms. All users must provide accurate information and maintain the security of their account credentials. Dealers are responsible for their own AB 1263 compliance obligations beyond the identity verification provided by CA2AChain.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These terms are subject to change. Continued use of the platform after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified terms. For questions about these terms, please contact our support team.
